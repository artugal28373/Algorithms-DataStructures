/*
flow with demands: capacity is defined by two values lo and hi, hi is maximum
allowable flow for this edge. lo is least amount flow that have to be sent in
this edge. to solve the problem add nsr and nsn. add an edge from nsr to 
every v, capacity will be sum of lo(ui-->v) for all u. also add an
edge from every u to nsn, capacity will be sum of lo(u-->vi) for all v.
add a final edge to sn to sr with infinite capacity. flow of this edge define
total flow of whole network. if all edges connected eith nsr is ed.f==ed.c then
the network satisfy all lower bound. otherwise not. the network will return an
arbitrary flow. by changing capacity of sn-->sr edge we can find the minimum flow
which satisfy all lower bound.

project and instrument problem: n project needs some subset m instrument. each 
project have some revenue and each instrument have some cost. select a subset of
project to maximize revenue. connect sr with project with capacity revenue and
sn with instrument with capacity cost. connect project with corresponding instrument
with infinite capacity. revenue will be (sum of revenue)-flow().

minimum weight vertex cover: add source with left side with capacity(=weight) and sink
with right side with capacity(=weight). every other edge is infinite capacity.
run flow.

maximum weight independent set: total weight-minimum weight vertex cover.
